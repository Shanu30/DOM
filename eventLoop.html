    <h1>Event Loop</h1>
    <p>Javascript is a single-threaded language at runtime which means only one thing can happen at a time. It also
        means you canâ€™t perform long operations such as network access without blocking the main thread.By using
        asynchronous programming, you can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.</br>
        When you open a website in the browser, it uses a single JavaScript execution thread. That thread is responsible
        to handle everything, like scrolling the web page, printing something on the web page, listen to DOM events.To
        understand how this code is executed we have to understand event loop.
